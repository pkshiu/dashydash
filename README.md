# dashydash

A dashboard application intended for home use. It keeps your appointments, family pictures, bus connections, ... at glance.

## Technologies

The application is implemented using **Node.js** and **React**.

## Modules

These are some of the mentioned modules displayed on the dashboard. A lot of
them are specific and tailored to my family's needs, but feel free to extend them or add your own.

Here's an example of how this dashboard looks like.

![The dashboard in action.](dashboard-example.png)

### abc

This lets my 4 year old learn the alphabet in a playful way. It displays capital letters and images of things starting with this letter.

###  appointments / birthdays

Displays a list of upcoming appointments or birthdays fetched from Google calendars using the [npm ical package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ical).

### blog

This module displays the title, a short description and the date of my latest blog post. It acts as a subtle reminder to come up with a new post should I let too much time pass without one.

### bus

The bus schedule from home to work. Very useful.

### family

A couple of years ago I built this [website](https://ziegler-family.com). It acts as a little helper tool for planning our family activities. This module reminds us of the currently planned activity.

### football

Displays time and venue of the upcoming game of my favorite football team [Borussia Dortmund](http://bvb.de).

### games

These are a couple of 32x32 pixel animations reminding of retro computer games. I actually built this as a testing environment for [another project](https://wolfgang-ziegler.com/blog/arduino-led-picture-frame) but considered it way too nice to be kept in hiding.

### movies

This component has no actual visual representation. It only runs on the server side and periodically checks my regular movie theater for new OV movies. If a new OV version of a movie is released, I get a mobile phone notification using [**IFTTT**](https://ifttt.com). Nifty.

### news

This one cycles through a list of news head lines and pictures taken from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/).

### pics

This is my favorite module by far. It looks for a special album in my Google photos collectionb and displays its pictures. That way, I only have to add my favorite new photos to this album and I automatically seen them on the dashboard. Awesome!

### weather

Using data from [openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org/), this module displays weather information for a given location.


## Boards

These modules are arranged in configurations called *Boards*. Arranging these boards is simply a matter of editing a **JSON configuration file**. The layout in the picture above e.g. is configured like this (the numbers between the square brackets represent *top / left / width / height* position in a 8 x 6 grid.

```js
"main" : {
  "modules" : {     
    "timeofday" :    [ 1, 1, 5, 1 ],
    "appointments" : [ 1, 2, 2, 3 ],
    "birthdays" :    [ 3, 2, 2, 3 ],
    "pics" :         [ 5, 2, 4, 3 ],
    "games" :        [ 4, 5, 1, 1 ],
    "family" :       [ 1, 5, 2, 1 ],
    "blog" :         [ 3, 6, 2, 1 ],
    "weather" :      [ 6, 1, 3, 1 ],
    "bus" :          [ 5, 5, 2, 2 ],
    "abc" :          [ 8, 5, 1, 1 ],
    "football" :     [ 7, 6, 1, 1 ]
  }
}
```

So, displaying a component (e.g. pictures) full screen can be done like this:

```js
"photos" : {
  "modules" : {     
    "pics" : [ 1, 1, 8, 6 ]
  }
}  
```

Switching between these layouts ("boards") happens automatically after a certain amount of time or - of course - manually.

## Build

* use nvm to install node
* at root directory:
* npm install
* copy secrets.template.json to secrets.json, enter your own API keys
* node_modules/.bin/gulp

## Installation

* You cannot build the application on the Raspberry Pi itself because node-sass is not supported on the ARM architecture.
* You have to copy the dist folder to the pi after building it on the host machine
